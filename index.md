## What's this website for?

This website was an attempt to make IISER-M's internet presence larger by a couple of seniors,
@tuAtulArora and @gagan-preet. The Turing Club now attempts to revive this attempt.
Hence, this is an informal website made by the students of IISER Mohali for everyone to access and see.

Presently, our first goal is to add the following -
  - Sites for all the clubs and maybe labs
  - [IISER Android app](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/IISER-Android)
  - [IISER PC app](https://github.com/DhruvaSambrani/iiserm_pc)
  - [Course related file repository](course_files)
  - Archive of Summer Projects
  - Manthan
